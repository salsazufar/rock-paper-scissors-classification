## Introduction

This project was created as part of the graduation requirements for the "Learn Machine Learning for Beginners" course organized by Dicoding. In this project, we use a dataset of rock, paper, and scissors images and train a CNN model to classify these images.

## Features
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras to build the CNN model.
- The dataset consists of rock, paper, and scissors images.
- Implemented in a Google Colab notebook.
- The model can detect images with good accuracy after training.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salsazufar/rock-paper-scissors-classification.git
    ```
2. Open the Google Colab notebook (`notebooks/rock_paper_scissors_classification.ipynb`) and follow the steps to train and test the model.
